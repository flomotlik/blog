## Behavior-driven development with Cucumber

[Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) lets you write your feature in natural language and develop them behavior-driven afterwards. It is written in Ruby, but you can also use it with several other languages, including the Java Virtual Machine, Python and PHP. Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki) to find out more.
