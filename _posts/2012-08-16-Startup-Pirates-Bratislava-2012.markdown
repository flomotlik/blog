We got an invitation to do an investor pitch workshop for the 
[Startup Pirates Bratislava](http://bratislava.startuppirates.org) event. We are always 
happy to help young entrepreneurs and therefore we took the train and rushed to Bratislava 
yesterday.

###Practise, practise & practise

Pitching is not science, you don't need a PhD for it. The most important point is practise, practise and practise. 
It's like juggling. Do it really often and you will get better. Do it hundreds of times and you will be really good. 
And it's the same with pitching.

###Push yourself outside your comfort zone

Always! The problem with presenting, especially if you are not good at it, is that you are afraid of talking 
in front of a crowd. That's the reason why you have to do it - often and again & again. It's not easy at the 
beginning but like everything in life, your learning curve is extremely steep. So you will perform better super fast.

###You always pitch

And by the way, you have to learn it if you wanna be a successful entrepreneur. Because you always pitch. Not only in front of an investor or 
to your customers. You also pitch to your friends, parents and even to random strangers on the street. Use all those pitches, learn from it 
and try to get better. You definitely need the ability to pitch in order to hire great employees (you won't convince them with a bad pitch), 
attract new customers and get the support from partners or also from friends & family.
