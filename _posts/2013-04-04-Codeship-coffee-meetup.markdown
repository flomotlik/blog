Today Codeship sponsored some free coffee and got mentors and teams of this Spring's TechStars Boston class and the Boston Startup Institute together at Voltage Coffee in Cambridge. We really enjoyed having you all around and hope you got some more value out of the meetup than just free coffee.

Having connected many Startups for years back in Europe it was a natural thing for us to also do this in Boston. We try to connect smart people with other smart people. Doing so is nothing we do out of expedience but because it's just a thing we inherently enjoy doing. Our core belief is that everyone profits from bringing likeminded souls together. The TechStars program is of course of great help for that.

The Codeship crew really enjoyed talking to Michael Pullen and Douglas Ross and got great feedback on User Experience from them. We are overwhelmed by the expertise and honest interest you guys show in our product. Thank you so much for your helpful insights. You help us making our product better. In the end that is what we all want.

## Thanks
